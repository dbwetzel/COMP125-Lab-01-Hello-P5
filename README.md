# Welcome to COMP 125 on repl.it!
If you're seeing this, you have successfully created your account and joined up with COMP 125 @ Loyola University Chicago.

In this lab, you will connect this project to the P5.js code library and run a simple P5 sketch to prove that it works. Once you have done that, submit your lab for course credit.

## instructions

1) Look at the "Files" tab in the left sidebar. You should see three files. Besides the file you are reading now (README.md) there are two essential files for this project (viewable as a web page): index**.html** and script**.js**. To complete this lab, you will edit each of these files a little bit ...

2) **Link your Repl to the P5.js Code Library** (Don't worry if that doesn't mean anything to you yet). Copy and paste the following code block in _index.html_ at line 8:

`<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.0.0/p5.min.js"></script>`

3) **Prove that it works.** Add the following code block to _script.js_ (type it this time. Don't copy and paste!):

```
function setup(){
```

```
  fill(0);
```

```
  ellipse(50, 50, 50, 50)
```

```
}
```

.. and press "run ->" at the top.

If everything is correct, you should see a black circle on the upper left corner of the "result" window. If so, submit your work!
